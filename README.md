# Collaborative Filtering, Trust-aware, and Hybrid model Recommendation system

In this project three models of recommender systems proposed and tested on the FilmTrust dataet (https://guoguibing.github.io/librec/datasets.html). Three metrics of Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error(RMSE), and Rate Coverage(RC) was used to evaluate these recommender systems. Surprise package (https://surpriselib.com/) was used for the implementation and a class added to the package in order to implement these models.
